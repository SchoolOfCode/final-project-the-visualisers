It is intended as\nan aid for teachers, not as the body of knowledge that should be learnt by pupils. Apart\nfrom a few which are used only in schools (for example, root word), the terms below are\nused with the meanings defined here in most modern books on English grammar. It is\nrecognised that there are different schools of thought on grammar, but the terms defined\nhere clarify those being used in the programmes of study. For further details, teachers\nshould consult the many books that are available.\nTerms in definitions\nAs in any tightly structured area of knowledge, grammar, vocabulary and spelling involve a\nnetwork of technical concepts that help to define each other. Consequently, the definition\nof one concept builds on other concepts that are equally technical. Concepts that are\ndefined elsewhere in the glossary are hyperlinked. For some concepts, the technical\ndefinition may be slightly different from the meaning that some teachers may have learnt at\nschool or may have been using with their own pupils; in these cases, the more familiar\nmeaning is also discussed.\nTerm Guidance Example\nactive voice An active verb has its usual pattern\nof subject and object (in contrast with\nthe passive).\nActive: The school arranged a visit.\nPassive: A visit was arranged by\nthe school.\nadjective The surest way to identify adjectives\nis by the ways they can be used:\n before a noun, to make the\nnoun’s meaning more specific\n(i.e. to modify the noun), or\n after the verb be, as its\ncomplement.\nAdjectives cannot be modified by\nother adjectives. This distinguishes\nthem from nouns, which can be.\nAdjectives are sometimes called\n‘describing words’ because they pick\nout single characteristics such as\nsize or colour. This is often true, but\nit doesn’t help to distinguish\nadjectives from other word classes,\nThe pupils did some really good\nwork. [adjective used before a\nnoun, to modify it]\nTheir work was good. [adjective\nused after the verb be, as its\ncomplement]\nNot adjectives:\nThe lamp glowed. [verb]\nIt was such a bright red! [noun]\nHe spoke loudly. [adverb]\nIt was a French grammar book.\n[noun]\nEnglish\n81\nTerm Guidance Example\nbecause verbs, nouns and adverbs\ncan do the same thing.\nadverb The surest way to identify adverbs is\nby the ways they can be used: they\ncan modify a verb, an adjective,\nanother adverb or even a whole\nclause.\nAdverbs are sometimes said to\ndescribe manner or time. This is\noften true, but it doesn’t help to\ndistinguish adverbs from other word\nclasses that can be used as\nadverbials, such as preposition\nphrases, noun phrases and\nsubordinate clauses.\nUsha soon started snoring loudly.\n[adverbs modifying the verbs\nstarted and snoring]\nThat match was really exciting!\n[adverb modifying the adjective\nexciting]\nWe don’t get to play games very\noften. [adverb modifying the other\nadverb, often]\nFortunately, it didn’t rain. [adverb\nmodifying the whole clause ‘it didn’t\nrain’ by commenting on it]\nNot adverbs:\n Usha went up the stairs.\n[preposition phrase used as\nadverbial]\n She finished her work this\nevening. [noun phrase used as\nadverbial]\n She finished when the teacher\ngot cross. [subordinate clause\nused as adverbial]\nadverbial An adverbial is a word or phrase that\nis used, like an adverb, to modify a\nverb or clause. Of course, adverbs\ncan be used as adverbials, but many\nother types of words and phrases\ncan be used this way, including\npreposition phrases and subordinate\nclauses.\nThe bus leaves in five minutes.\n[preposition phrase as adverbial:\nmodifies leaves]\nShe promised to see him last night.\n[noun phrase modifying either\npromised or see, according to the\nintended meaning]\nShe worked until she had finished.\n[subordinate clause as adverbial]\nantonym Two words are antonyms if their\nmeanings are opposites.\nhot – cold\nlight – dark\nlight – heavy\napostrophe Apostrophes have two completely\ndifferent uses:\n showing the place of missing\nletters (e.g. I’m for I am)\nI’m going out and I won’t be long.\n[showing missing letters]\nHannah’s mother went to town in\nJustin’s car. [marking possessives]\nEnglish\n82\nTerm Guidance Example\n marking possessives\n(e.g. Hannah’s mother).\narticle The articles the (definite) and a or an\n(indefinite) are the most common\ntype of determiner.\nThe dog found a bone in an old\nbox.\nauxiliary verb The auxiliary verbs are: be, have, do\nand the modal verbs. They can be\nused to make questions and\nnegative statements. In addition:\n be is used in the progressive and\npassive\n have is used in the perfect\n do is used to form questions and\nnegative statements if no other\nauxiliary verb is present\nThey are winning the match. [be\nused in the progressive]\nHave you finished your picture?\n[have used to make a question,\nand the perfect]\nNo, I don’t know him. [do used to\nmake a negative; no other auxiliary\nis present]\nWill you come with me or not?\n[modal verb will used to make a\nquestion about the other person’s\nwillingness]\nclause A clause is a special type of phrase\nwhose head is a verb. Clauses can\nsometimes be complete sentences.\nClauses may be main or\nsubordinate.\nTraditionally, a clause had to have a\nfinite verb, but most modern\ngrammarians also recognise nonfinite clauses.\nIt was raining. [single-clause\nsentence]\nIt was raining but we were indoors.\n[two finite clauses]\nIf you are coming to the party,\nplease let us know. [finite\nsubordinate clause inside a finite\nmain clause]\nUsha went upstairs to play on her\ncomputer. [non-finite clause]\ncohesion A text has cohesion if it is clear how\nthe meanings of its parts fit together.\nCohesive devices can help to do\nthis.\nIn the example, there are repeated\nreferences to the same thing (shown\nby the different style pairings), and\nthe logical relations, such as time\nand cause, between different parts\nare clear.\nA visit has been arranged for Year\n6, to the Mountain Peaks Field\nStudy Centre, leaving school at\n9.30am. This is an overnight\nvisit. The centre has beautiful\ngrounds and a nature trail. During\nthe afternoon, the children will\nfollow the trail.\ncohesive device Cohesive devices are words used to\nshow how the different parts of a text\nfit together. In other words, they\ncreate cohesion.\nJulia’s dad bought her a football.\nThe football was expensive!\n[determiner; refers us back to a\nparticular football]\nEnglish\n83\nTerm Guidance Example\nSome examples of cohesive devices\nare:\n determiners and pronouns, which\ncan refer back to earlier words\n conjunctions and adverbs, which\ncan make relations between\nwords clear\n ellipsis of expected words.\nJoe was given a bike for\nChristmas. He liked it very much.\n[the pronouns refer back to Joe\nand the bike]\nWe’ll be going shopping before we\ngo to the park. [conjunction; makes\na relationship of time clear]\nI’m afraid we’re going to have to\nwait for the next train. Meanwhile,\nwe could have a cup of tea.\n[adverb; refers back to the time of\nwaiting]\nWhere are you going? [ ] To\nschool! [ellipsis of the expected\nwords I’m going; links the answer\nback to the question]\ncomplement A verb’s subject complement adds\nmore information about its subject,\nand its object complement does the\nsame for its object.\nUnlike the verb’s object, its\ncomplement may be an adjective.\nThe verb be normally has a\ncomplement.\nShe is our teacher. [adds more\ninformation about the subject, she]\nThey seem very competent. [adds\nmore information about the subject,\nthey]\nLearning makes me happy. [adds\nmore information about the object,\nme]\ncompound,\ncompounding\nA compound word contains at least\ntwo root words in its morphology;\ne.g. whiteboard, superman.\nCompounding is very important in\nEnglish.\nblackbird, blow-dry, bookshop, icecream, English teacher, inkjet, oneeyed, bone-dry, baby-sit,\ndaydream, outgrow\nconjunction A conjunction links two words or\nphrases together.\nThere are two main types of\nconjunctions:\n co-ordinating conjunctions (e.g.\nand) link two words or phrases\ntogether as an equal pair\n subordinating conjunctions (e.g.\nwhen) introduce a subordinate\nclause.\nJames bought a bat and ball. [links\nthe words bat and ball as an equal\npair]\nKylie is young but she can kick the\nball hard. [links two clauses as an\nequal pair]\nEveryone watches when Kyle does\nback-flips. [introduces a\nsubordinate clause]\nJoe can’t practise kicking because\nhe’s injured. [introduces a\nsubordinate clause]\nEnglish\n84\nTerm Guidance Example\nconsonant A sound which is produced when the\nspeaker closes off or obstructs the\nflow of air through the vocal tract,\nusually using lips, tongue or teeth.\nMost of the letters of the alphabet\nrepresent consonants. Only the\nletters a, e, i, o, u and y can\nrepresent vowel sounds.\n/p/ [flow of air stopped by the lips,\nthen released]\n/t/ [flow of air stopped by the\ntongue touching the roof of the\nmouth, then released]\n/f/ [flow of air obstructed by the\nbottom lip touching the top teeth]\n/s/ [flow of air obstructed by the tip\nof the tongue touching the gum\nline]\ncontinuous See progressive\nco-ordinate,\nco-ordination\nWords or phrases are co-ordinated if\nthey are linked as an equal pair by a\nco-ordinating conjunction (i.e. and,\nbut, or).\nIn the examples on the right, the coordinated elements are shown in\nbold, and the conjunction is\nunderlined.\nThe difference between\nco-ordination and subordination is\nthat, in subordination, the two linked\nelements are not equal.\nSusan and Amra met in a café.\n[links the words Susan and Amra\nas an equal pair]\nThey talked and drank tea for an\nhour. [links two clauses as an\nequal pair]\nSusan got a bus but Amra\nwalked. [links two clauses as an\nequal pair]\nNot co-ordination: They ate before\nthey met. [before introduces a\nsubordinate clause]\ndeterminer A determiner specifies a noun as\nknown or unknown, and it goes\nbefore any modifiers (e.g. adjectives\nor other nouns).\nSome examples of determiners are:\n articles (the, a or an)\n demonstratives (e.g. this, those)\n possessives (e.g. my, your)\n quantifiers (e.g. some, every).\nthe home team [article, specifies\nthe team as known]\na good team [article, specifies the\nteam as unknown]\nthat pupil [demonstrative, known]\nJulia’s parents [possessive, known]\nsome big boys [quantifier,\nunknown]\nContrast: home the team, big some\nboys [both incorrect, because the\ndeterminer should come before\nother modifiers]\ndigraph A type of grapheme where two\nletters represent one phoneme.\nSometimes, these two letters are not\nnext to one another; this is called a\nThe digraph ea in each is\npronounced /i:/.\nThe digraph sh in shed is\npronounced /ʃ/.\nEnglish\n85\nTerm Guidance Example\nsplit digraph. The split digraph i–e in line is\npronounced /aɪ/.\nellipsis Ellipsis is the omission of a word or\nphrase which is expected and\npredictable.\nFrankie waved to Ivana and she\nwatched her drive away.\nShe did it because she wanted to\ndo it.\netymology A word’s etymology is its history: its\norigins in earlier forms of English or\nother languages, and how its form\nand meaning have changed. Many\nwords in English have come from\nGreek, Latin or French.\nThe word school was borrowed\nfrom a Greek word ó÷ïëÞ (skholé)\nmeaning ‘leisure’.\nThe word verb comes from Latin\nverbum, meaning ‘word’.\nThe word mutton comes from\nFrench mouton, meaning ‘sheep’.\nfinite verb Every sentence typically has at least\none verb which is either past or\npresent tense. Such verbs are called\n‘finite’. The imperative verb in a\ncommand is also finite.\nVerbs that are not finite, such as\nparticiples or infinitives, cannot stand\non their own: they are linked to\nanother verb in the sentence.\nLizzie does the dishes every day.\n[present tense]\nEven Hana did the dishes\nyesterday. [past tense]\nDo the dishes, Naser! [imperative]\nNot finite verbs:\n I have done them. [combined\nwith the finite verb have]\n I will do them. [combined with\nthe finite verb will]\n I want to do them! [combined\nwith the finite verb want]\nfronting, fronted A word or phrase that normally\ncomes after the verb may be moved\nbefore the verb: when this happens,\nwe say it has been ‘fronted’. For\nexample, a fronted adverbial is an\nadverbial which has been moved\nbefore the verb.\nWhen writing fronted phrases, we\noften follow them with a comma.\nBefore we begin, make sure you’ve\ngot a pencil.\n[Without fronting: Make sure you’ve\ngot a pencil before we begin.]\nThe day after tomorrow, I’m visiting\nmy granddad.\n[Without fronting: I’m visiting my\ngranddad the day after tomorrow.]\nfuture Reference to future time can be\nmarked in a number of different ways\nin English. All these ways involve the\nuse of a present-tense verb.\nSee also tense.\nUnlike many other languages (such\nHe will leave tomorrow. [presenttense will followed by infinitive\nleave]\nHe may leave tomorrow. [presenttense may followed by infinitive\nleave]\nEnglish\n86\nTerm Guidance Example\nas French, Spanish or Italian),\nEnglish has no distinct ‘future tense’\nform of the verb comparable with its\npresent and past tenses.\nHe leaves tomorrow. [presenttense leaves]\nHe is going to leave tomorrow.\n[present tense is followed by going\nto plus the infinitive leave]\nGPC See grapheme-phoneme\ncorrespondences.\ngrapheme A letter, or combination of letters,\nthat corresponds to a single\nphoneme within a word.\nThe grapheme t in the words ten,\nbet and ate corresponds to the\nphoneme /t/.\nThe grapheme ph in the word\ndolphin corresponds to the\nphoneme /f/.\ngraphemephoneme\ncorrespondences\nThe links between letters, or\ncombinations of letters (graphemes)\nand the speech sounds (phonemes)\nthat they represent.\nIn the English writing system,\ngraphemes may correspond to\ndifferent phonemes in different\nwords.\nThe grapheme s corresponds to\nthe phoneme /s/ in the word see,\nbut…\n…it corresponds to the phoneme\n/z/ in the word easy.\nhead See phrase.\nhomonym Two different words are homonyms if\nthey both look exactly the same\nwhen written, and sound exactly the\nsame when pronounced.\nHas he left yet? Yes – he went\nthrough the door on the left.\nThe noise a dog makes is called a\nbark. Trees have bark.\nhomophone Two different words are\nhomophones if they sound exactly\nthe same when pronounced.\nhear, here\nsome, sum\ninfinitive A verb’s infinitive is the basic form\nused as the head-word in a\ndictionary (e.g. walk, be).\nInfinitives are often used:\n after to\n after modal verbs.\nI want to walk.\nI will be quiet.\ninflection When we add -ed to walk, or change\nmouse to mice, this change of\nmorphology produces an inflection\n(‘bending’) of the basic word which\nhas special grammar (e.g. past tense\ndogs is an inflection of dog.\nwent is an inflection of go.\nbetter is an inflection of good.\nEnglish\n87\nTerm Guidance Example\nor plural). In contrast, adding -er to\nwalk produces a completely different\nword, walker, which is part of the\nsame word family. Inflection is\nsometimes thought of as merely a\nchange of ending, but, in fact, some\nwords change completely when\ninflected.\nintransitive verb A verb which does not need an\nobject in a sentence to complete its\nmeaning is described as intransitive.\nSee ‘transitive verb’.\nWe all laughed.\nWe would like to stay longer, but\nwe must leave.\nmain clause A sentence contains at least one\nclause which is not a subordinate\nclause; such a clause is a main\nclause. A main clause may contain\nany number of subordinate clauses.\nIt was raining but the sun was\nshining. [two main clauses]\nThe man who wrote it told me that\nit was true. [one main clause\ncontaining two subordinate\nclauses.]\nShe said, “It rained all day.” [one\nmain clause containing another.]\nmodal verb Modal verbs are used to change the\nmeaning of other verbs. They can\nexpress meanings such as certainty,\nability, or obligation. The main modal\nverbs are will, would, can, could,\nmay, might, shall, should, must and\nought.\nA modal verb only has finite forms\nand has no suffixes (e.g. I sing – he\nsings, but not I must – he musts).\nI can do this maths work by myself.\nThis ride may be too scary for you!\nYou should help your little brother.\nIs it going to rain? Yes, it might.\nCanning swim is important. [not\npossible because can must be\nfinite; contrast: Being able to swim\nis important, where being is not a\nmodal verb]\nmodify, modifier One word or phrase modifies\nanother by making its meaning more\nspecific.\nBecause the two words make a\nphrase, the ‘modifier’ is normally\nclose to the modified word.\nIn the phrase primary-school\nteacher:\n teacher is modified by primaryschool (to mean a specific kind\nof teacher)\n school is modified by primary\n(to mean a specific kind of\nschool).\nmorphology A word’s morphology is its internal\nmake-up in terms of root words and\nsuffixes or prefixes, as well as other\nkinds of change such as the change\ndogs has the morphological makeup: dog + s.\nunhelpfulness has the\nEnglish\n88\nTerm Guidance Example\nof mouse to mice.\nMorphology may be used to produce\ndifferent inflections of the same word\n(e.g. boy – boys), or entirely new\nwords (e.g. boy – boyish) belonging\nto the same word family.\nA word that contains two or more\nroot words is a compound (e.g.\nnews+paper, ice+cream).\nmorphological make-up:\nunhelpful + ness\n where unhelpful = un + helpful\n and helpful = help + ful\nnoun The surest way to identify nouns is\nby the ways they can be used after\ndeterminers such as the: for\nexample, most nouns will fit into the\nframe “The __ matters/matter.”\nNouns are sometimes called ‘naming\nwords’ because they name people,\nplaces and ‘things’; this is often true,\nbut it doesn’t help to distinguish\nnouns from other word classes. For\nexample, prepositions can name\nplaces and verbs can name ‘things’\nsuch as actions.\nNouns may be classified as\ncommon (e.g. boy, day) or proper\n(e.g. Ivan, Wednesday), and also as\ncountable (e.g. thing, boy) or noncountable (e.g. stuff, money). These\nclasses can be recognised by the\ndeterminers they combine with.\nOur dog bit the burglar on his\nbehind!\nMy big brother did an amazing\njump on his skateboard.\nActions speak louder than words.\nNot nouns:\n He’s behind you! [this names a\nplace, but is a preposition, not\na noun]\n She can jump so high! [this\nnames an action, but is a verb,\nnot a noun]\ncommon, countable: a book,\nbooks, two chocolates, one day,\nfewer ideas\ncommon, non-countable: money,\nsome chocolate, less imagination\nproper, countable: Marilyn,\nLondon, Wednesday\nnoun phrase A noun phrase is a phrase with a\nnoun as its head, e.g. some foxes,\nfoxes with bushy tails. Some\ngrammarians recognise one-word\nphrases, so that foxes are\nmultiplying would contain the noun\nfoxes acting as the head of the noun\nphrase foxes.\nAdult foxes can jump. [adult\nmodifies foxes, so adult belongs to\nthe noun phrase]\nAlmost all healthy adult foxes in\nthis area can jump. [all the other\nwords help to modify foxes, so they\nall belong to the noun phrase]\nobject An object is normally a noun,\npronoun or noun phrase that comes\nstraight after the verb, and shows\nwhat the verb is acting upon.\nObjects can be turned into the\nYear 2 designed puppets. [noun\nacting as object]\nI like that. [pronoun acting as\nobject]\nEnglish\n89\nTerm Guidance Example\nsubject of a passive verb, and\ncannot be adjectives (contrast with\ncomplements).\nSome people suggested a pretty\ndisplay. [noun phrase acting as\nobject]\nContrast:\n A display was suggested.\n[object of active verb becomes\nthe subject of the passive verb]\n Year 2 designed pretty.\n[incorrect, because adjectives\ncannot be objects]\nparticiple Verbs in English have two\nparticiples, called ‘present participle’\n(e.g. walking, taking) and ‘past\nparticiple’ (e.g. walked, taken).\nUnfortunately, these terms can be\nconfusing to learners, because:\n they don’t necessarily have\nanything to do with present or\npast time\n although past participles are\nused as perfects (e.g. has eaten)\nthey are also used as passives\n(e.g. was eaten).\nHe is walking to school. [present\nparticiple in a progressive]\nHe has taken the bus to school.\n[past participle in a perfect]\nThe photo was taken in the rain.\n[past participle in a passive]\npassive The sentence It was eaten by our\ndog is the passive of Our dog ate it.\nA passive is recognisable from:\n the past participle form eaten\n the normal object (it) turned into\nthe subject\n the normal subject (our dog)\nturned into an optional\npreposition phrase with by as its\nhead\n the verb be(was), or some other\nverb such as get.\nContrast active.\nA verb is not ‘passive’ just because it\nhas a passive meaning: it must be\nthe passive version of an active verb.\nA visit was arranged by the school.\nOur cat got run over by a bus.\nActive versions:\n The school arranged a visit.\n A bus ran over our cat.\nNot passive:\n He received a warning. [past\ntense, active received]\n We had an accident. [past\ntense, active had]\npast tense Verbs in the past tense are\ncommonly used to:\nTom and Chris showed me their\nnew TV. [names an event in the\nEnglish\n90\nTerm Guidance Example\n talk about the past\n talk about imagined situations\n make a request sound more\npolite.\nMost verbs take a suffix –ed, to form\ntheir past tense, but many\ncommonly-used verbs are irregular.\nSee also tense.\npast]\nAntonio went on holiday to Brazil.\n[names an event in the past;\nirregular past of go]\nI wish I had a puppy. [names an\nimagined situation, not a situation\nin the past]\nI was hoping you’d help tomorrow.\n[makes an implied request sound\nmore polite]\nperfect The perfect form of a verb generally\ncalls attention to the consequences\nof a prior event; for example, he has\ngone to lunch implies that he is still\naway, in contrast with he went to\nlunch. ‘Had gone to lunch’ takes a\npast time point (i.e. when we arrived)\nas its reference point and is another\nway of establishing time relations in\na text. The perfect tense is formed\nby:\n turning the verb into its past\nparticiple inflection\n adding a form of the verb have\nbefore it.\nIt can also be combined with the\nprogressive (e.g. he has been\ngoing).\nShe has downloaded some songs.\n[present perfect; now she has\nsome songs]\nI had eaten lunch when you came.\n[past perfect; I wasn’t hungry when\nyou came]\nphoneme A phoneme is the smallest unit of\nsound that signals a distinct,\ncontrasting meaning. For example:\n /t/ contrasts with /k/ to signal the\ndifference between tap and cap\n /t/ contrasts with /l/ to signal the\ndifference between bought and\nball.\nIt is this contrast in meaning that tells\nus there are two distinct phonemes\nat work.\nThere are around 44 phonemes in\nEnglish; the exact number depends\non regional accents. A single\nThe word cat has three letters and\nthree phonemes: /kæt/\nThe word catch has five letters and\nthree phonemes: /kaʧ/\nThe word caught has six letters\nand three phonemes: /kɔ:t/\nEnglish\n91\nTerm Guidance Example\nphoneme may be represented in\nwriting by one, two, three or four\nletters constituting a single\ngrapheme.\nphrase A phrase is a group of words that are\ngrammatically connected so that\nthey stay together, and that expand\na single word, called the ‘head’. The\nphrase is a noun phrase if its head is\na noun, a preposition phrase if its\nhead is a preposition, and so on; but\nif the head is a verb, the phrase is\ncalled a clause. Phrases can be\nmade up of other phrases.\nShe waved to her mother. [a noun\nphrase, with the noun mother as its\nhead]\nShe waved to her mother.

It is\nformed by combining the verb’s\npresent participle (e.g. singing) with\na form of the verb be (e.g. he was\nsinging). The progressive can also\nbe combined with the perfect (e.g. he\nhas been singing).\nMichael is singing in the store\nroom. [present progressive]\nAmanda was making a patchwork\nquilt.

[stage direction]\nrelative clause A relative clause is a special type of\nsubordinate clause that modifies a\nnoun. It often does this by using a\nrelative pronoun such as who or that\nto refer back to that noun, though the\nrelative pronoun that is often omitted.\nA relative clause may also be\nattached to a clause. In that case,\nthe pronoun refers back to the whole\nclause, rather than referring back to\na noun.\nIn the examples, the relative clauses\nare underlined, and both the\npronouns and the words they refer\nback to are in bold.\nThat’s the boy who lives near\nschool. [who refers back to boy]\nThe prize that I won was a book.\n[that refers back to prize]\nThe prize I won was a book. [the\npronoun that is omitted]\nTom broke the game, which\nannoyed Ali. [which refers back to\nthe whole clause]\nroot word Morphology breaks words down into\nroot words, which can stand alone,\nand suffixes or prefixes which can’t.\nFor example, help is the root word\nfor other words in its word family\nsuch as helpful and helpless, and\nalso for its inflections such as\nhelping. Compound words (e.g. helpdesk) contain two or more root\nwords. When looking in a dictionary,\nwe sometimes have to look for the\nplayed [the root word is play]\nunfair [the root word is fair]\nfootball [the root words are foot\nand ball]\nEnglish\n94\nTerm Guidance Example\nroot word (or words) of the word we\nare interested in.\nschwa The name of a vowel sound that is\nfound only in unstressed positions in\nEnglish.

The terms ‘singleclause sentence’ and ‘multi-clause\nsentence’ may be more helpful.\nJohn went to his friend’s house. He\nstayed there till tea-time.\nJohn went to his friend’s house, he\nstayed there till tea-time.

The other\nsyllables are unstressed.\nabout\nvisit\nsubject The subject of a verb is normally the\nnoun, noun phrase or pronoun that\nnames the ‘do-er’ or ‘be-er’. The\nsubject’s normal position is:\n just before the verb in a\nstatement\n just after the auxiliary verb, in a\nquestion.\nUnlike the verb’s object and\ncomplement, the subject can\ndetermine the form of the verb (e.g. I\nam, you are).\nRula’s mother went out.\nThat is uncertain.\nThe children will study the animals.\nWill the children study the animals?\nsubjunctive In some languages, the inflections of\na verb include a large range of\nspecial forms which are used\ntypically in subordinate clauses, and\nare called ‘subjunctives’.

They\nshould start with fractions where the denominator of one fraction is a multiple of the other\n(for example, 2\n1 + 8\n1 = 8\n5 ) and progress to varied and increasingly complex problems.\nPupils should use a variety of images to support their understanding of multiplication\nwith fractions. This follows earlier work about fractions as operators (fractions of), as\nnumbers, and as equal parts of objects, for example as parts of a rectangle.\nPupils use their understanding of the relationship between unit fractions and division to\nwork backwards by multiplying a quantity that represents a unit fraction to find the whole\nquantity (for example, if 4\n1 of a length is 36cm, then the whole length is 36 × 4 = 144cm).\nThey practise calculations with simple fractions and decimal fraction equivalents to aid\nfluency, including listing equivalent fractions to identify fractions with common\ndenominators.\nPupils can explore and make conjectures about converting a simple fraction to a decimal\nfraction (for example, 3 ÷ 8 = 0.375). For simple fractions with recurring decimal\nequivalents, pupils learn about rounding the decimal to three decimal places, or other\nappropriate approximations depending on the context. Pupils multiply and divide\nnumbers with up to two decimal places by one-digit and two-digit whole numbers. Pupils\nmultiply decimals by whole numbers, starting with the simplest cases, such as 0.4 × 2 =\n0.8, and in practical contexts, such as measures and money.\nPupils are introduced to the division of decimal numbers by one-digit whole number,\ninitially, in practical contexts involving measures and money. They recognise division\ncalculations as the inverse of multiplication.\nPupils also develop their skills of rounding and estimating as a means of predicting and\nchecking the order of magnitude of their answers to decimal calculations. This includes\nrounding answers to a specified degree of accuracy and checking the reasonableness of\ntheir answers.\nMathematics\n138\nRatio and proportion\nStatutory requirements\nPupils should be taught to:\n solve problems involving the relative sizes of two quantities where missing values\ncan be found by using integer multiplication and division facts\n solve problems involving the calculation of percentages [for example, of measures,\nand such as 15% of 360] and the use of percentages for comparison\n solve problems involving similar shapes where the scale factor is known or can be\nfound\n solve problems involving unequal sharing and grouping using knowledge of fractions\nand multiples.\nNotes and guidance (non-statutory)\nPupils recognise proportionality in contexts when the relations between quantities are in\nthe same ratio (for example, similar shapes and recipes).\nPupils link percentages or 360° to calculating angles of pie charts.\nPupils should consolidate their understanding of ratio when comparing quantities, sizes\nand scale drawings by solving a variety of problems. They might use the notation a:b to\nrecord their work.\nPupils solve problems involving unequal quantities, for example, ‘for every egg you need\nthree spoonfuls of flour’, ‘ 5\n3 of the class are boys’. These problems are the foundation for\nlater formal approaches to ratio and proportion.\nAlgebra\nStatutory requirements\nPupils should be taught to:\n use simple formulae\n generate and describe linear number sequences\n express missing number problems algebraically\n find pairs of numbers that satisfy an equation with two unknowns\n enumerate possibilities of combinations of two variables.\nMathematics\n139\nNotes and guidance (non-statutory)\nPupils should be introduced to the use of symbols and letters to represent variables and\nunknowns in mathematical situations that they already understand, such as:\n missing numbers, lengths, coordinates and angles\n formulae in mathematics and science\n equivalent expressions (for example, a + b = b + a)\n generalisations of number patterns\n number puzzles (for example, what two numbers can add up to).\nMeasurement\nStatutory requirements\nPupils should be taught to:\n solve problems involving the calculation and conversion of units of measure, using\ndecimal notation up to three decimal places where appropriate\n use, read, write and convert between standard units, converting measurements of\nlength, mass, volume and time from a smaller unit of measure to a larger unit, and\nvice versa, using decimal notation to up to three decimal places\n convert between miles and kilometres\n recognise that shapes with the same areas can have different perimeters and vice\nversa\n recognise when it is possible to use formulae for area and volume of shapes\n calculate the area of parallelograms and triangles\n calculate, estimate and compare volume of cubes and cuboids using standard units,\nincluding cubic centimetres (cm3\n) and cubic metres (m3\n), and extending to other units\n[for example, mm3 and km3\n].\nNotes and guidance (non-statutory)\nPupils connect conversion (for example, from kilometres to miles) to a graphical\nrepresentation as preparation for understanding linear/proportional graphs.\nThey know approximate conversions and are able to tell if an answer is sensible.\nUsing the number line, pupils use, add and subtract positive and negative integers for\nmeasures such as temperature.\nMathematics\n140\nNotes and guidance (non-statutory)\nThey relate the area of rectangles to parallelograms and triangles, for example, by\ndissection, and calculate their areas, understanding and using the formulae (in words or\nsymbols) to do this.\nPupils could be introduced to compound units for speed, such as miles per hour, and\napply their knowledge in science or other subjects as appropriate.\nGeometry – properties of shapes\nStatutory requirements\nPupils should be taught to:\n draw 2-D shapes using given dimensions and angles\n recognise, describe and build simple 3-D shapes, including making nets\n compare and classify geometric shapes based on their properties and sizes and find\nunknown angles in any triangles, quadrilaterals, and regular polygons\n illustrate and name parts of circles, including radius, diameter and circumference and\nknow that the diameter is twice the radius\n recognise angles where they meet at a point, are on a straight line, or are vertically\nopposite, and find missing angles.\nNotes and guidance (non-statutory)\nPupils draw shapes and nets accurately, using measuring tools and conventional\nmarkings and labels for lines and angles.\nPupils describe the properties of shapes and explain how unknown angles and lengths\ncan be derived from known measurements.\nThese relationships might be expressed algebraically for example, d = 2 × r;\na = 180 – (b + c).\nMathematics\n141\nGeometry – position and direction\nStatutory requirements\nPupils should be taught to:\n describe positions on the full coordinate grid (all four quadrants)\n draw and translate simple shapes on the coordinate plane, and reflect them in the\naxes.\nNotes and guidance (non-statutory)\nPupils draw and label a pair of axes in all four quadrants with equal scaling. This\nextends their knowledge of one quadrant to all four quadrants, including the use of\nnegative numbers.\nPupils draw and label rectangles (including squares), parallelograms and rhombuses,\nspecified by coordinates in the four quadrants, predicting missing coordinates using the\nproperties of shapes. These might be expressed algebraically for example, translating\nvertex (a, b) to (a – 2, b + 3); (a, b) and (a + d, b + d) being opposite vertices of a square\nof side d.\nStatistics\nStatutory requirements\nPupils should be taught to:\n interpret and construct pie charts and line graphs and use these to solve problems\n calculate and interpret the mean as an average.\nNotes and guidance (non-statutory)\nPupils connect their work on angles, fractions and percentages to the interpretation of\npie charts.\nPupils both encounter and draw graphs relating two variables, arising from their own\nenquiry and in other subjects.\nThey should connect conversion from kilometres to miles in measurement to its\ngraphical representation.\nPupils know when it is appropriate to find the mean of a data set.\n\nNO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, USE SHORT ANSWERS!

It is intended as\nan aid for teachers, not as the body of knowledge that should be learnt by pupils. Apart\nfrom a few which are used only in schools (for example, root word), the terms below are\nused with the meanings defined here in most modern books on English grammar. It is\nrecognised that there are different schools of thought on grammar, but the terms defined\nhere clarify those being used in the programmes of study. For further details, teachers\nshould consult the many books that are available.\nTerms in definitions\nAs in any tightly structured area of knowledge, grammar, vocabulary and spelling involve a\nnetwork of technical concepts that help to define each other. Consequently, the definition\nof one concept builds on other concepts that are equally technical. Concepts that are\ndefined elsewhere in the glossary are hyperlinked. For some concepts, the technical\ndefinition may be slightly different from the meaning that some teachers may have learnt at\nschool or may have been using with their own pupils; in these cases, the more familiar\nmeaning is also discussed.\nTerm Guidance Example\nactive voice An active verb has its usual pattern\nof subject and object (in contrast with\nthe passive).\nActive: The school arranged a visit.\nPassive: A visit was arranged by\nthe school.\nadjective The surest way to identify adjectives\nis by the ways they can be used:\n before a noun, to make the\nnoun’s meaning more specific\n(i.e. to modify the noun), or\n after the verb be, as its\ncomplement.\nAdjectives cannot be modified by\nother adjectives. This distinguishes\nthem from nouns, which can be.\nAdjectives are sometimes called\n‘describing words’ because they pick\nout single characteristics such as\nsize or colour. This is often true, but\nit doesn’t help to distinguish\nadjectives from other word classes,\nThe pupils did some really good\nwork. [adjective used before a\nnoun, to modify it]\nTheir work was good. [adjective\nused after the verb be, as its\ncomplement]\nNot adjectives:\nThe lamp glowed. [verb]\nIt was such a bright red! [noun]\nHe spoke loudly. [adverb]\nIt was a French grammar book.\n[noun]\nEnglish\n81\nTerm Guidance Example\nbecause verbs, nouns and adverbs\ncan do the same thing.\nadverb The surest way to identify adverbs is\nby the ways they can be used: they\ncan modify a verb, an adjective,\nanother adverb or even a whole\nclause.\nAdverbs are sometimes said to\ndescribe manner or time. This is\noften true, but it doesn’t help to\ndistinguish adverbs from other word\nclasses that can be used as\nadverbials, such as preposition\nphrases, noun phrases and\nsubordinate clauses.\nUsha soon started snoring loudly.\n[adverbs modifying the verbs\nstarted and snoring]\nThat match was really exciting!\n[adverb modifying the adjective\nexciting]\nWe don’t get to play games very\noften. [adverb modifying the other\nadverb, often]\nFortunately, it didn’t rain. [adverb\nmodifying the whole clause ‘it didn’t\nrain’ by commenting on it]\nNot adverbs:\n Usha went up the stairs.\n[preposition phrase used as\nadverbial]\n She finished her work this\nevening. [noun phrase used as\nadverbial]\n She finished when the teacher\ngot cross. [subordinate clause\nused as adverbial]\nadverbial An adverbial is a word or phrase that\nis used, like an adverb, to modify a\nverb or clause. Of course, adverbs\ncan be used as adverbials, but many\nother types of words and phrases\ncan be used this way, including\npreposition phrases and subordinate\nclauses.\nThe bus leaves in five minutes.\n[preposition phrase as adverbial:\nmodifies leaves]\nShe promised to see him last night.\n[noun phrase modifying either\npromised or see, according to the\nintended meaning]\nShe worked until she had finished.\n[subordinate clause as adverbial]\nantonym Two words are antonyms if their\nmeanings are opposites.\nhot – cold\nlight – dark\nlight – heavy\napostrophe Apostrophes have two completely\ndifferent uses:\n showing the place of missing\nletters (e.g. I’m for I am)\nI’m going out and I won’t be long.\n[showing missing letters]\nHannah’s mother went to town in\nJustin’s car. [marking possessives]\nEnglish\n82\nTerm Guidance Example\n marking possessives\n(e.g. Hannah’s mother).\narticle The articles the (definite) and a or an\n(indefinite) are the most common\ntype of determiner.\nThe dog found a bone in an old\nbox.\nauxiliary verb The auxiliary verbs are: be, have, do\nand the modal verbs. They can be\nused to make questions and\nnegative statements. In addition:\n be is used in the progressive and\npassive\n have is used in the perfect\n do is used to form questions and\nnegative statements if no other\nauxiliary verb is present\nThey are winning the match. [be\nused in the progressive]\nHave you finished your picture?\n[have used to make a question,\nand the perfect]\nNo, I don’t know him. [do used to\nmake a negative; no other auxiliary\nis present]\nWill you come with me or not?\n[modal verb will used to make a\nquestion about the other person’s\nwillingness]\nclause A clause is a special type of phrase\nwhose head is a verb. Clauses can\nsometimes be complete sentences.\nClauses may be main or\nsubordinate.\nTraditionally, a clause had to have a\nfinite verb, but most modern\ngrammarians also recognise nonfinite clauses.\nIt was raining. [single-clause\nsentence]\nIt was raining but we were indoors.\n[two finite clauses]\nIf you are coming to the party,\nplease let us know. [finite\nsubordinate clause inside a finite\nmain clause]\nUsha went upstairs to play on her\ncomputer. [non-finite clause]\ncohesion A text has cohesion if it is clear how\nthe meanings of its parts fit together.\nCohesive devices can help to do\nthis.\nIn the example, there are repeated\nreferences to the same thing (shown\nby the different style pairings), and\nthe logical relations, such as time\nand cause, between different parts\nare clear.\nA visit has been arranged for Year\n6, to the Mountain Peaks Field\nStudy Centre, leaving school at\n9.30am. This is an overnight\nvisit. The centre has beautiful\ngrounds and a nature trail. During\nthe afternoon, the children will\nfollow the trail.\ncohesive device Cohesive devices are words used to\nshow how the different parts of a text\nfit together. In other words, they\ncreate cohesion.\nJulia’s dad bought her a football.\nThe football was expensive!\n[determiner; refers us back to a\nparticular football]\nEnglish\n83\nTerm Guidance Example\nSome examples of cohesive devices\nare:\n determiners and pronouns, which\ncan refer back to earlier words\n conjunctions and adverbs, which\ncan make relations between\nwords clear\n ellipsis of expected words.\nJoe was given a bike for\nChristmas. He liked it very much.\n[the pronouns refer back to Joe\nand the bike]\nWe’ll be going shopping before we\ngo to the park. [conjunction; makes\na relationship of time clear]\nI’m afraid we’re going to have to\nwait for the next train. Meanwhile,\nwe could have a cup of tea.\n[adverb; refers back to the time of\nwaiting]\nWhere are you going? [ ] To\nschool! [ellipsis of the expected\nwords I’m going; links the answer\nback to the question]\ncomplement A verb’s subject complement adds\nmore information about its subject,\nand its object complement does the\nsame for its object.\nUnlike the verb’s object, its\ncomplement may be an adjective.\nThe verb be normally has a\ncomplement.\nShe is our teacher. [adds more\ninformation about the subject, she]\nThey seem very competent. [adds\nmore information about the subject,\nthey]\nLearning makes me happy. [adds\nmore information about the object,\nme]\ncompound,\ncompounding\nA compound word contains at least\ntwo root words in its morphology;\ne.g. whiteboard, superman.\nCompounding is very important in\nEnglish.\nblackbird, blow-dry, bookshop, icecream, English teacher, inkjet, oneeyed, bone-dry, baby-sit,\ndaydream, outgrow\nconjunction A conjunction links two words or\nphrases together.\nThere are two main types of\nconjunctions:\n co-ordinating conjunctions (e.g.\nand) link two words or phrases\ntogether as an equal pair\n subordinating conjunctions (e.g.\nwhen) introduce a subordinate\nclause.\nJames bought a bat and ball. [links\nthe words bat and ball as an equal\npair]\nKylie is young but she can kick the\nball hard. [links two clauses as an\nequal pair]\nEveryone watches when Kyle does\nback-flips. [introduces a\nsubordinate clause]\nJoe can’t practise kicking because\nhe’s injured. [introduces a\nsubordinate clause]\nEnglish\n84\nTerm Guidance Example\nconsonant A sound which is produced when the\nspeaker closes off or obstructs the\nflow of air through the vocal tract,\nusually using lips, tongue or teeth.\nMost of the letters of the alphabet\nrepresent consonants. Only the\nletters a, e, i, o, u and y can\nrepresent vowel sounds.\n/p/ [flow of air stopped by the lips,\nthen released]\n/t/ [flow of air stopped by the\ntongue touching the roof of the\nmouth, then released]\n/f/ [flow of air obstructed by the\nbottom lip touching the top teeth]\n/s/ [flow of air obstructed by the tip\nof the tongue touching the gum\nline]\ncontinuous See progressive\nco-ordinate,\nco-ordination\nWords or phrases are co-ordinated if\nthey are linked as an equal pair by a\nco-ordinating conjunction (i.e. and,\nbut, or).\nIn the examples on the right, the coordinated elements are shown in\nbold, and the conjunction is\nunderlined.\nThe difference between\nco-ordination and subordination is\nthat, in subordination, the two linked\nelements are not equal.\nSusan and Amra met in a café.\n[links the words Susan and Amra\nas an equal pair]\nThey talked and drank tea for an\nhour. [links two clauses as an\nequal pair]\nSusan got a bus but Amra\nwalked. [links two clauses as an\nequal pair]\nNot co-ordination: They ate before\nthey met. [before introduces a\nsubordinate clause]\ndeterminer A determiner specifies a noun as\nknown or unknown, and it goes\nbefore any modifiers (e.g. adjectives\nor other nouns).\nSome examples of determiners are:\n articles (the, a or an)\n demonstratives (e.g. this, those)\n possessives (e.g. my, your)\n quantifiers (e.g. some, every).\nthe home team [article, specifies\nthe team as known]\na good team [article, specifies the\nteam as unknown]\nthat pupil [demonstrative, known]\nJulia’s parents [possessive, known]\nsome big boys [quantifier,\nunknown]\nContrast: home the team, big some\nboys [both incorrect, because the\ndeterminer should come before\nother modifiers]\ndigraph A type of grapheme where two\nletters represent one phoneme.\nSometimes, these two letters are not\nnext to one another; this is called a\nThe digraph ea in each is\npronounced /i:/.\nThe digraph sh in shed is\npronounced /ʃ/.\nEnglish\n85\nTerm Guidance Example\nsplit digraph. The split digraph i–e in line is\npronounced /aɪ/.\nellipsis Ellipsis is the omission of a word or\nphrase which is expected and\npredictable.\nFrankie waved to Ivana and she\nwatched her drive away.\nShe did it because she wanted to\ndo it.\netymology A word’s etymology is its history: its\norigins in earlier forms of English or\nother languages, and how its form\nand meaning have changed. Many\nwords in English have come from\nGreek, Latin or French.\nThe word school was borrowed\nfrom a Greek word ó÷ïëÞ (skholé)\nmeaning ‘leisure’.\nThe word verb comes from Latin\nverbum, meaning ‘word’.\nThe word mutton comes from\nFrench mouton, meaning ‘sheep’.\nfinite verb Every sentence typically has at least\none verb which is either past or\npresent tense. Such verbs are called\n‘finite’. The imperative verb in a\ncommand is also finite.\nVerbs that are not finite, such as\nparticiples or infinitives, cannot stand\non their own: they are linked to\nanother verb in the sentence.\nLizzie does the dishes every day.\n[present tense]\nEven Hana did the dishes\nyesterday. [past tense]\nDo the dishes, Naser! [imperative]\nNot finite verbs:\n I have done them. [combined\nwith the finite verb have]\n I will do them. [combined with\nthe finite verb will]\n I want to do them! [combined\nwith the finite verb want]\nfronting, fronted A word or phrase that normally\ncomes after the verb may be moved\nbefore the verb: when this happens,\nwe say it has been ‘fronted’. For\nexample, a fronted adverbial is an\nadverbial which has been moved\nbefore the verb.\nWhen writing fronted phrases, we\noften follow them with a comma.\nBefore we begin, make sure you’ve\ngot a pencil.\n[Without fronting: Make sure you’ve\ngot a pencil before we begin.]\nThe day after tomorrow, I’m visiting\nmy granddad.\n[Without fronting: I’m visiting my\ngranddad the day after tomorrow.]\nfuture Reference to future time can be\nmarked in a number of different ways\nin English. All these ways involve the\nuse of a present-tense verb.\nSee also tense.\nUnlike many other languages (such\nHe will leave tomorrow. [presenttense will followed by infinitive\nleave]\nHe may leave tomorrow. [presenttense may followed by infinitive\nleave]\nEnglish\n86\nTerm Guidance Example\nas French, Spanish or Italian),\nEnglish has no distinct ‘future tense’\nform of the verb comparable with its\npresent and past tenses.\nHe leaves tomorrow. [presenttense leaves]\nHe is going to leave tomorrow.\n[present tense is followed by going\nto plus the infinitive leave]\nGPC See grapheme-phoneme\ncorrespondences.\ngrapheme A letter, or combination of letters,\nthat corresponds to a single\nphoneme within a word.\nThe grapheme t in the words ten,\nbet and ate corresponds to the\nphoneme /t/.\nThe grapheme ph in the word\ndolphin corresponds to the\nphoneme /f/.\ngraphemephoneme\ncorrespondences\nThe links between letters, or\ncombinations of letters (graphemes)\nand the speech sounds (phonemes)\nthat they represent.\nIn the English writing system,\ngraphemes may correspond to\ndifferent phonemes in different\nwords.\nThe grapheme s corresponds to\nthe phoneme /s/ in the word see,\nbut…\n…it corresponds to the phoneme\n/z/ in the word easy.\nhead See phrase.\nhomonym Two different words are homonyms if\nthey both look exactly the same\nwhen written, and sound exactly the\nsame when pronounced.\nHas he left yet? Yes – he went\nthrough the door on the left.\nThe noise a dog makes is called a\nbark. Trees have bark.\nhomophone Two different words are\nhomophones if they sound exactly\nthe same when pronounced.\nhear, here\nsome, sum\ninfinitive A verb’s infinitive is the basic form\nused as the head-word in a\ndictionary (e.g. walk, be).\nInfinitives are often used:\n after to\n after modal verbs.\nI want to walk.\nI will be quiet.\ninflection When we add -ed to walk, or change\nmouse to mice, this change of\nmorphology produces an inflection\n(‘bending’) of the basic word which\nhas special grammar (e.g. past tense\ndogs is an inflection of dog.\nwent is an inflection of go.\nbetter is an inflection of good.\nEnglish\n87\nTerm Guidance Example\nor plural). In contrast, adding -er to\nwalk produces a completely different\nword, walker, which is part of the\nsame word family. Inflection is\nsometimes thought of as merely a\nchange of ending, but, in fact, some\nwords change completely when\ninflected.\nintransitive verb A verb which does not need an\nobject in a sentence to complete its\nmeaning is described as intransitive.\nSee ‘transitive verb’.\nWe all laughed.\nWe would like to stay longer, but\nwe must leave.\nmain clause A sentence contains at least one\nclause which is not a subordinate\nclause; such a clause is a main\nclause. A main clause may contain\nany number of subordinate clauses.\nIt was raining but the sun was\nshining. [two main clauses]\nThe man who wrote it told me that\nit was true. [one main clause\ncontaining two subordinate\nclauses.]\nShe said, “It rained all day.” [one\nmain clause containing another.]\nmodal verb Modal verbs are used to change the\nmeaning of other verbs. They can\nexpress meanings such as certainty,\nability, or obligation. The main modal\nverbs are will, would, can, could,\nmay, might, shall, should, must and\nought.\nA modal verb only has finite forms\nand has no suffixes (e.g. I sing – he\nsings, but not I must – he musts).\nI can do this maths work by myself.\nThis ride may be too scary for you!\nYou should help your little brother.\nIs it going to rain? Yes, it might.\nCanning swim is important. [not\npossible because can must be\nfinite; contrast: Being able to swim\nis important, where being is not a\nmodal verb]\nmodify, modifier One word or phrase modifies\nanother by making its meaning more\nspecific.\nBecause the two words make a\nphrase, the ‘modifier’ is normally\nclose to the modified word.\nIn the phrase primary-school\nteacher:\n teacher is modified by primaryschool (to mean a specific kind\nof teacher)\n school is modified by primary\n(to mean a specific kind of\nschool).\nmorphology A word’s morphology is its internal\nmake-up in terms of root words and\nsuffixes or prefixes, as well as other\nkinds of change such as the change\ndogs has the morphological makeup: dog + s.\nunhelpfulness has the\nEnglish\n88\nTerm Guidance Example\nof mouse to mice.\nMorphology may be used to produce\ndifferent inflections of the same word\n(e.g. boy – boys), or entirely new\nwords (e.g. boy – boyish) belonging\nto the same word family.\nA word that contains two or more\nroot words is a compound (e.g.\nnews+paper, ice+cream).\nmorphological make-up:\nunhelpful + ness\n where unhelpful = un + helpful\n and helpful = help + ful\nnoun The surest way to identify nouns is\nby the ways they can be used after\ndeterminers such as the: for\nexample, most nouns will fit into the\nframe “The __ matters/matter.”\nNouns are sometimes called ‘naming\nwords’ because they name people,\nplaces and ‘things’; this is often true,\nbut it doesn’t help to distinguish\nnouns from other word classes. For\nexample, prepositions can name\nplaces and verbs can name ‘things’\nsuch as actions.\nNouns may be classified as\ncommon (e.g. boy, day) or proper\n(e.g. Ivan, Wednesday), and also as\ncountable (e.g. thing, boy) or noncountable (e.g. stuff, money). These\nclasses can be recognised by the\ndeterminers they combine with.\nOur dog bit the burglar on his\nbehind!\nMy big brother did an amazing\njump on his skateboard.\nActions speak louder than words.\nNot nouns:\n He’s behind you! [this names a\nplace, but is a preposition, not\na noun]\n She can jump so high! [this\nnames an action, but is a verb,\nnot a noun]\ncommon, countable: a book,\nbooks, two chocolates, one day,\nfewer ideas\ncommon, non-countable: money,\nsome chocolate, less imagination\nproper, countable: Marilyn,\nLondon, Wednesday\nnoun phrase A noun phrase is a phrase with a\nnoun as its head, e.g. some foxes,\nfoxes with bushy tails. Some\ngrammarians recognise one-word\nphrases, so that foxes are\nmultiplying would contain the noun\nfoxes acting as the head of the noun\nphrase foxes.\nAdult foxes can jump. [adult\nmodifies foxes, so adult belongs to\nthe noun phrase]\nAlmost all healthy adult foxes in\nthis area can jump. [all the other\nwords help to modify foxes, so they\nall belong to the noun phrase]\nobject An object is normally a noun,\npronoun or noun phrase that comes\nstraight after the verb, and shows\nwhat the verb is acting upon.\nObjects can be turned into the\nYear 2 designed puppets.

[names an event in the\nEnglish\n90\nTerm Guidance Example\n talk about the past\n talk about imagined situations\n make a request sound more\npolite.\nMost verbs take a suffix –ed, to form\ntheir past tense, but many\ncommonly-used verbs are irregular.\nSee also tense.\npast]\nAntonio went on holiday to Brazil.\n[names an event in the past;\nirregular past of go]\nI wish I had a puppy. [names an\nimagined situation, not a situation\nin the past]\nI was hoping you’d help tomorrow.\n[makes an implied request sound\nmore polite]\nperfect The perfect form of a verb generally\ncalls attention to the consequences\nof a prior event; for example, he has\ngone to lunch implies that he is still\naway, in contrast with he went to\nlunch. ‘Had gone to lunch’ takes a\npast time point (i.e. when we arrived)\nas its reference point and is another\nway of establishing time relations in\na text. The perfect tense is formed\nby:\n turning the verb into its past\nparticiple inflection\n adding a form of the verb have\nbefore it.\nIt can also be combined with the\nprogressive (e.g. he has been\ngoing).\nShe has downloaded some songs.\n[present perfect; now she has\nsome songs]\nI had eaten lunch when you came.\n[past perfect; I wasn’t hungry when\nyou came]\nphoneme A phoneme is the smallest unit of\nsound that signals a distinct,\ncontrasting meaning. For example:\n /t/ contrasts with /k/ to signal the\ndifference between tap and cap\n /t/ contrasts with /l/ to signal the\ndifference between bought and\nball.\nIt is this contrast in meaning that tells\nus there are two distinct phonemes\nat work.\nThere are around 44 phonemes in\nEnglish; the exact number depends\non regional accents.

The\nphrase is a noun phrase if its head is\na noun, a preposition phrase if its\nhead is a preposition, and so on; but\nif the head is a verb, the phrase is\ncalled a clause. Phrases can be\nmade up of other phrases.\nShe waved to her mother. [a noun\nphrase, with the noun mother as its\nhead]\nShe waved to her mother.

It is\nformed by combining the verb’s\npresent participle (e.g. singing) with\na form of the verb be (e.g. he was\nsinging). The progressive can also\nbe combined with the perfect (e.g. he\nhas been singing).\nMichael is singing in the store\nroom. [present progressive]\nAmanda was making a patchwork\nquilt.

[stage direction]\nrelative clause A relative clause is a special type of\nsubordinate clause that modifies a\nnoun. It often does this by using a\nrelative pronoun such as who or that\nto refer back to that noun, though the\nrelative pronoun that is often omitted.\nA relative clause may also be\nattached to a clause. In that case,\nthe pronoun refers back to the whole\nclause, rather than referring back to\na noun.\nIn the examples, the relative clauses\nare underlined, and both the\npronouns and the words they refer\nback to are in bold.\nThat’s the boy who lives near\nschool. [who refers back to boy]\nThe prize that I won was a book.\n[that refers back to prize]\nThe prize I won was a book. [the\npronoun that is omitted]\nTom broke the game, which\nannoyed Ali. [which refers back to\nthe whole clause]\nroot word Morphology breaks words down into\nroot words, which can stand alone,\nand suffixes or prefixes which can’t.\nFor example, help is the root word\nfor other words in its word family\nsuch as helpful and helpless, and\nalso for its inflections such as\nhelping. Compound words (e.g. helpdesk) contain two or more root\nwords.

The terms ‘singleclause sentence’ and ‘multi-clause\nsentence’ may be more helpful.\nJohn went to his friend’s house. He\nstayed there till tea-time.\nJohn went to his friend’s house, he\nstayed there till tea-time.

They\nshould start with fractions where the denominator of one fraction is a multiple of the other\n(for example, 2\n1 + 8\n1 = 8\n5 ) and progress to varied and increasingly complex problems.\nPupils should use a variety of images to support their understanding of multiplication\nwith fractions. This follows earlier work about fractions as operators (fractions of), as\nnumbers, and as equal parts of objects, for example as parts of a rectangle.\nPupils use their understanding of the relationship between unit fractions and division to\nwork backwards by multiplying a quantity that represents a unit fraction to find the whole\nquantity (for example, if 4\n1 of a length is 36cm, then the whole length is 36 × 4 = 144cm).\nThey practise calculations with simple fractions and decimal fraction equivalents to aid\nfluency, including listing equivalent fractions to identify fractions with common\ndenominators.\nPupils can explore and make conjectures about converting a simple fraction to a decimal\nfraction (for example, 3 ÷ 8 = 0.375). For simple fractions with recurring decimal\nequivalents, pupils learn about rounding the decimal to three decimal places, or other\nappropriate approximations depending on the context. Pupils multiply and divide\nnumbers with up to two decimal places by one-digit and two-digit whole numbers. Pupils\nmultiply decimals by whole numbers, starting with the simplest cases, such as 0.4 × 2 =\n0.8, and in practical contexts, such as measures and money.\nPupils are introduced to the division of decimal numbers by one-digit whole number,\ninitially, in practical contexts involving measures and money. They recognise division\ncalculations as the inverse of multiplication.\nPupils also develop their skills of rounding and estimating as a means of predicting and\nchecking the order of magnitude of their answers to decimal calculations. This includes\nrounding answers to a specified degree of accuracy and checking the reasonableness of\ntheir answers.\nMathematics\n138\nRatio and proportion\nStatutory requirements\nPupils should be taught to:\n solve problems involving the relative sizes of two quantities where missing values\ncan be found by using integer multiplication and division facts\n solve problems involving the calculation of percentages [for example, of measures,\nand such as 15% of 360] and the use of percentages for comparison\n solve problems involving similar shapes where the scale factor is known or can be\nfound\n solve problems involving unequal sharing and grouping using knowledge of fractions\nand multiples.\nNotes and guidance (non-statutory)\nPupils recognise proportionality in contexts when the relations between quantities are in\nthe same ratio (for example, similar shapes and recipes).\nPupils link percentages or 360° to calculating angles of pie charts.\nPupils should consolidate their understanding of ratio when comparing quantities, sizes\nand scale drawings by solving a variety of problems. They might use the notation a:b to\nrecord their work.\nPupils solve problems involving unequal quantities, for example, ‘for every egg you need\nthree spoonfuls of flour’, ‘ 5\n3 of the class are boys’. These problems are the foundation for\nlater formal approaches to ratio and proportion.\nAlgebra\nStatutory requirements\nPupils should be taught to:\n use simple formulae\n generate and describe linear number sequences\n express missing number problems algebraically\n find pairs of numbers that satisfy an equation with two unknowns\n enumerate possibilities of combinations of two variables.\nMathematics\n139\nNotes and guidance (non-statutory)\nPupils should be introduced to the use of symbols and letters to represent variables and\nunknowns in mathematical situations that they already understand, such as:\n missing numbers, lengths, coordinates and angles\n formulae in mathematics and science\n equivalent expressions (for example, a + b = b + a)\n generalisations of number patterns\n number puzzles (for example, what two numbers can add up to).\nMeasurement\nStatutory requirements\nPupils should be taught to:\n solve problems involving the calculation and conversion of units of measure, using\ndecimal notation up to three decimal places where appropriate\n use, read, write and convert between standard units, converting measurements of\nlength, mass, volume and time from a smaller unit of measure to a larger unit, and\nvice versa, using decimal notation to up to three decimal places\n convert between miles and kilometres\n recognise that shapes with the same areas can have different perimeters and vice\nversa\n recognise when it is possible to use formulae for area and volume of shapes\n calculate the area of parallelograms and triangles\n calculate, estimate and compare volume of cubes and cuboids using standard units,\nincluding cubic centimetres (cm3\n) and cubic metres (m3\n), and extending to other units\n[for example, mm3 and km3\n].\nNotes and guidance (non-statutory)\nPupils connect conversion (for example, from kilometres to miles) to a graphical\nrepresentation as preparation for understanding linear/proportional graphs.\nThey know approximate conversions and are able to tell if an answer is sensible.\nUsing the number line, pupils use, add and subtract positive and negative integers for\nmeasures such as temperature.\nMathematics\n140\nNotes and guidance (non-statutory)\nThey relate the area of rectangles to parallelograms and triangles, for example, by\ndissection, and calculate their areas, understanding and using the formulae (in words or\nsymbols) to do this.\nPupils could be introduced to compound units for speed, such as miles per hour, and\napply their knowledge in science or other subjects as appropriate.\nGeometry – properties of shapes\nStatutory requirements\nPupils should be taught to:\n draw 2-D shapes using given dimensions and angles\n recognise, describe and build simple 3-D shapes, including making nets\n compare and classify geometric shapes based on their properties and sizes and find\nunknown angles in any triangles, quadrilaterals, and regular polygons\n illustrate and name parts of circles, including radius, diameter and circumference and\nknow that the diameter is twice the radius\n recognise angles where they meet at a point, are on a straight line, or are vertically\nopposite, and find missing angles.\nNotes and guidance (non-statutory)\nPupils draw shapes and nets accurately, using measuring tools and conventional\nmarkings and labels for lines and angles.\nPupils describe the properties of shapes and explain how unknown angles and lengths\ncan be derived from known measurements.\nThese relationships might be expressed algebraically for example, d = 2 × r;\na = 180 – (b + c).\nMathematics\n141\nGeometry – position and direction\nStatutory requirements\nPupils should be taught to:\n describe positions on the full coordinate grid (all four quadrants)\n draw and translate simple shapes on the coordinate plane, and reflect them in the\naxes.\nNotes and guidance (non-statutory)\nPupils draw and label a pair of axes in all four quadrants with equal scaling. This\nextends their knowledge of one quadrant to all four quadrants, including the use of\nnegative numbers.\nPupils draw and label rectangles (including squares), parallelograms and rhombuses,\nspecified by coordinates in the four quadrants, predicting missing coordinates using the\nproperties of shapes. These might be expressed algebraically for example, translating\nvertex (a, b) to (a – 2, b + 3); (a, b) and (a + d, b + d) being opposite vertices of a square\nof side d.\nStatistics\nStatutory requirements\nPupils should be taught to:\n interpret and construct pie charts and line graphs and use these to solve problems\n calculate and interpret the mean as an average.\nNotes and guidance (non-statutory)\nPupils connect their work on angles, fractions and percentages to the interpretation of\npie charts.\nPupils both encounter and draw graphs relating two variables, arising from their own\nenquiry and in other subjects.\nThey should connect conversion from kilometres to miles in measurement to its\ngraphical representation.\nPupils know when it is appropriate to find the mean of a data set.\n\nNO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, USE SHORT ANSWERS!
